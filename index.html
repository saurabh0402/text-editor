			Hello there.

			Hello Sir/Madam, <br>I have tried completing all the tasks given in the challenge. This text editor, as asked does following things:<br>
			<div class = "tabbed">
				<ul>
					<li> When user presses enter, a new paragraph is created with the new paragraph having the focus. </li>
					<li> User can drag and drop paragraphs to change their order. User can start the drag from the end or an empty region of the paragraph. While the user drags a paragraph, the regions where it could be dragged are highlighted and when drop on a valid region, the paragraph is moved there, if possible.
					<li> When user selects a word or a sentence, a tooltip is shown. From the tooltip user can select one of the four options - bold, underline, change color to red and change color to black.
					<li> User can add links using &lt;a&gt; tags. When the user clicks on Done, all the links are shown below the Done button. The links redirect to correct pages as specified in the &lt;a&gt; tag and to # if not specified.
					<li> If before selecting Done user checks the option to replace all four letter words, all the four letter words will be replaced by words generated from the link given.
				</ul>
			</div>
